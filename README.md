# Largest Series Product
## Getting Started

Run `npm install`

## Tests

Review the `series.js` file inside the `lib` directory, and then the `series.spec.js` file inside the `spec` directory. Review each of the tests, and then start implementing your solutions to make each test pass in `series.js`.

Run `grunt watch` then edit your files. Grunt will watch for changes. Grunt
will only run tests that start with `it`. When you finish passing a test,
remove the `x` from `xit` to convert it to a runnable test.

## Background
